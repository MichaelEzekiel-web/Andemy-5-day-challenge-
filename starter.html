    <a href="#">About Me</a>

    <h4>Coaching Technique</h4>
    <p>I've honed my coaching technique over the decades. I aim to communicate openly and clearly, addressing critical points and providing continuous, constructive feedback.</p>

    <h4>Goals</h4>
    <p>The process starts with clearly defined objectives. How will you know how to change if you don't know what needs changing. We'll develop your goals in conversation together.</p>

    <h4>Growth</h4>
    <p>The growth stage is the meat in the sandwich. It is here that you put new strategies to work, and begin addressing the issues that have been holding you back.</p>

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <p>At this point in the process I ask you to reflect on the changes you've made, and whether you're satisfied with there the results have led you. After this, we can address sustainability.</p>

        <p>“Oving helped me regain my confidence after being fired and helped me find a healthy routine that put me on track towards changing my career path. Now, I'm doing something that I always wanted to do.”</p>

        <p>“I struggled with all the new things that I was expected to do as an adult. Taxes, work - the stuff they don't teach you at school. I gained confidence, started taking more chances, and am even working towards getting into college.”</p>
